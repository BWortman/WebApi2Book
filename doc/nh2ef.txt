Install-Package EntityFramework -Version 6.1.3

Have to put Tasks property on Users (even though I didn't want to) to support the Many2Many

VersionedClassMap<T> -> EntityTypeConfiguration<T>

Change _session.QueryOver<T> to _dbContext.Set<T>

ToRowCount() to Count()   // test this!!

Set<T>.Find() to search by key, instead of Get<T>()

Used Set<T> instead of property getters


Make sure NH-related packages are removed from ./lib folder
